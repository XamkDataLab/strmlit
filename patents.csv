Here the aspect on how to choose a non biodegradable or both degradable wastes material for green concrete. It presents the feasibility of the usage of by product materials like fly ash, query dust, marble powder/ granules, plastic waste and recycled concrete and masonry as aggregates in concrete. To avoid the pollution and reuse the material, the present study is carried out. Thus, green concrete is an excellent substituent of cement as it is cheaper, because it uses waste products, saving energy consumption in the production. Over and above all green concrete has greater strength and durability than the normal concrete. Our study is focused on the rigid pavement concrete strength using steel fibre and Marble dust shows the analysis and conclusions. We have studied pertaining to steel fibre reinforced concrete and Marble dust, and their effects were also laid down to a particular conclusion. The conclusion that drawn out of the studies in terms of the compressive strength which shows an immense increase on use of steel fibre and Marble dust in the rigid pavement concrete. In my work, marble dust is used as a partial replacement of cement and observes the changes occurred in various cases of cube strength, split tensile strength and the flexural strength.

High strength (M60 grade) concrete was designed with water to cement ratio of 0.3, for severe exposure conditions. Tire rubber ash was partially substituted for cement from 0 to 15% by weight in multiples of 2.5%. The utilization of super plasticizer enabled sufficient workability of the fresh concrete, which exhibited blackish color depending on the quantity of rubber ash used. The specimens were tested for compressive strength, flexural tensile strength, splitting tensile strength, density, water absorption and behavior at high temperature (fire resistance). The process helps in the reduction of cement in concrete, reducing the emission of carbon dioxide to the environment; also it makes an effective solution for the effective disposal of tire rubber ash that pollutes the environment. Therefore, this invention is an inexpensive, environmental and user friendly as well as it converts the wastes into the best in its manufacturing. Furthermore, the compressive strength of tire ash concrete remains almost similar to that of the control concrete, even after incorporating ten percent rubber tire rubber ash. The tire rubber cementitious composite has proven very effective against high temperature, making the concrete fire resistant.

For manufacturing of cement and other materials related to construction, nearly 60% of earth resources were utilized and by continuous extraction of these materials leads to rapid depletion of natural resources at very soon. In worldwide, it was assessed that during the manufacturing of cement alone emit nearly 7% of carbon dioxide and it was directly induce the greenhouse effect and create pollution such as acid rain, depletion of ozone etc. On other side, the industrial wastes are available in vast quantity and that may be utilized in the concrete either directly or by the combination of industrial waste with different bonding additives. The industrial wastes are constituent of heavy pollutants, during the dumping it may cause harmful health effects to living organisms and it may also act as carcinogenic agent. For this study, the combination of industrial waste are taken to form a new novel material called ""Ferrock"" and it was usually the mixture of Lime stone, Iron dust, Fly ash, Metakaolin and Loose sand at different proportion. The main aim of this study is to enhance the engineering property of concrete by adding ferrock, instead of cement in the form of powder at different proportion of 0, 5,10,15 and 20 percentage. For initial study, the compressive strength of various proportions are examined by casting cement mortar and allow them to curing for the different periods of 7 days, 14 days and 28 days. Further, the cured cement mortar cubes were subjected to compressive stress and the property was examined. From the result it was found that, the compressive strength obtained during addition of Ferrock powder at the proportion of 5 and 10 percentage can provides higher strength than conventional cement mortar. In other side, the higher proportions such as 15 and 20 percentage of ferrock may decline the strength of cement mortar by way of increasing the plasticity nature of cement paste.

Accordingly, the long-term strength of concrete is increased, and drying shrinkage can be minimized. Furthermore, water resistance and fire resistance can be greatly enhanced.
